# Algorithms and Data Structures

The purpose of this repository is to provide some data structures and algorithms in various languages.
All the code in this repository is commented and thoroughly tested.
If you find any mistake, please let me know.

You can reuse it without constraint, but do not forget to credit me as the author.
You can also find some of the Java classes in the algs4.jar library maintained by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, both teachers and researchers at Princeton University.

There will be no regular update of this repository, I may not write anything for months or I may as well push hundreds of lines during a week.

I sincerely hope this will be helpful.

If you have any particular wish or suggestion, feel free to contact me.
